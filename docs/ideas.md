Innovative Idea: 
Our project is to use the pokemon API and have a strategy web app. 
The user can put in the pokemon they are facing or the type and we can provide the best pokemon to use against them, where to find them, and just an overall display of information on the best steps to take to defeat it.

Important Components: 
The interactive portion of the application will be where the user can type in the name of the pokemon that they are looking to defeat. There will be a button that the user can select after typing in their opponent which will then generate a strategy for the user to defeat that pokemon. The strategy will provide multiple layers of advice. The first will provide a list of pokemon that would be most effective in order to defeat the one that they typed in. For each of the suggestions, there will be a location for where they are likely to find that specific pokemon which they can use to narrow down the choices and select one that is closest. In addition, certain moves provide the most damage to certain types, so for each pokemon there will be a top couple of moves that would be recommended in order to further guarantee victory. 

There will also be an option for the user to type in the pokemon that they currently have and then the feedback will be which pokemon they should utilize in the fight to ensure the most success. They may not want to spend time hunting down pokemon, so a strategy of what they can do with what they currently have will certainly be beneficial.There may be more sections of analysis as the project contninues, but the overall goal is to provide useful infomration to the user that will allow them to defeat the challenger they are facing.
